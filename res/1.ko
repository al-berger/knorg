Computer network

* Definition

The transmission media (often referred to in the literature as the physical
medium) used to link devices to form a computer network include electrical
cable, optical fiber, and free space.


# Wired

* [Topic]
Network links

* Coaxial cable
Is widely used for cable television systems, office
buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks. Transmission speed
ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per
second.

* ITU-T Ghn technology
Uses existing home wiring (coaxial cable, phone lines
and power lines) to create a high-speed local area network.

* Twisted pair
Is used for wired Ethernet and other standards. It
typically consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for
both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together
helps to reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic induction. The transmission
speed ranges from 2 Mbit/s to 10 Gbit/s. Twisted pair cabling comes in two
forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each
form comes in several category ratings, designed for use in various
scenarios.

* Optical fiber 
It carries pulses of light that
represent data via lasers and optical amplifiers. Some advantages of
optical fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity
to electrical interference. Using dense wave division multiplexing, optical
fibers can simultaneously carry multiple streams of data on different
wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be
sent to up to trillions of bits per second. Optic fibers can be used for
long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for undersea
cables to interconnect continents. There are two basic types of fiber
optics, single-mode optical fiber (SMF) and multi-mode optical fiber (MMF).
Single-mode fiber has the advantage of being able to sustain a coherent
signal for dozens or even a hundred kilometers. Multimode fiber is cheaper
to terminate but is limited to a few hundred or even only a few dozens of
meters, depending on the data rate and cable grade.


# Wireless

* [Topic]
Network links

* Terrestrial microwave
Terrestrial microwave communication uses
Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes.
Terrestrial microwaves are in the low gigahertz range, which limits all
communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately 40
miles (64 km) apart.

* Communications satellites
Satellites also communicate via microwave. The
satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit
35,400 km (22,000 mi) above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are
capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals.

* Cellular networks
Use several radio communications technologies. The
systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area
is served by a low-power transceiver.

* Radio and spread spectrum technologies
Wireless LANs use a high-frequency
radio technology similar to digital cellular. Wireless LANs use spread
spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a
limited area. IEEE 802.11 defines a common flavor of open-standards
wireless radio-wave technology known as Wi-Fi.

* Free-space optical communication
Uses visible or invisible light for
communications. In most cases, line-of-sight propagation is used, which
limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.


# Network nodes

* [Topic]
Computer network

* Definition

Apart from any physical transmission media, networks are built from additional
basic system building blocks, such as network interface controllers (NICs),
repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches, routers, modems, and firewalls. Any
particular piece of equipment will frequently contain multiple building blocks
and so may perform multiple functions.

* Network interfaces

A network interface circuit with a port for ATM
 
An ATM network interface in the form of an accessory card. A lot of network
interfaces are built-in.

A network interface controller (NIC) is computer hardware that connects the
computer to the network media and has the ability to process low-level network
information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable,
or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated
circuitry.

In Ethernet networks, each network interface controller has a unique Media
Access Control (MAC) addressâ€”usually stored in the controller's permanent
memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC
address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six octets. The
three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These
manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three
least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.

* Repeaters and hubs

A repeater is an electronic device that receives a network signal, cleans it of
unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal is retransmitted at a higher
power level, or to the other side of obstruction so that the signal can cover
longer distances without degradation. In most twisted pair Ethernet
configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100
meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers
apart.

Repeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model but still require a small
amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a propagation delay
that affects network performance and may affect proper function. As a result,
many network architectures limit the number of repeaters used in a network,
e.g., the Ethernet 5-4-3 rule.

An Ethernet repeater with multiple ports is known as an Ethernet hub. In
addition to reconditioning and distributing network signals, a repeater hub
assists with collision detection and fault isolation for the network. Hubs and
repeaters in LANs have been largely obsoleted by modern network switches.

* Bridges and switches

Network bridges and network switches are distinct from a hub in that they only
forward frames to the ports involved in the communication whereas a hub
forwards to all ports. Bridges only have two ports but a switch can be
thought of as a multi-port bridge. Switches normally have numerous ports,
facilitating a star topology for devices, and for cascading additional
switches.

Bridges and switches operate at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model
and bridge traffic between two or more network segments to form a single local
network. Both are devices that forward frames of data between ports based on
the destination MAC address in each frame. They learn the association of
physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received
frames and only forward the frame when necessary. If an unknown destination MAC
is targeted, the device broadcasts the request to all ports except the source,
and discovers the location from the reply.

Bridges and switches divide the network's collision domain but maintain a
single broadcast domain. Network segmentation through bridging and switching
helps break down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller,
more efficient networks.

* Routers

A router is an internetworking device that forwards packets between networks by
processing the addressing or routing information included in the packet. The
routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table. A
router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets and does
not require broadcasting packets which is inefficient for very big networks.

* Modems

Modems (modulator-demodulator) are used to connect network nodes via wire not
originally designed for digital network traffic, or for wireless. To do this
one or more carrier signals are modulated by the digital signal to produce an
analog signal that can be tailored to give the required properties for
transmission. Early modems modulated audio signals sent over a standard voice
telephone line. Modems are still commonly used for telephone lines, using a
digital subscriber line technology and cable television systems using DOCSIS
technology.

* Firewalls

A firewall is a network device or software for controlling network security and
access rules. Firewalls are inserted in connections between secure internal
networks and potentially insecure external networks such as the Internet.
Firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized
sources while allowing actions from recognized ones. The vital role firewalls
play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in cyber
attacks.


# Network packet 

* Definition

Most modern computer networks use protocols based on packet-mode transmission.
A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched
network.

Computer network


# Network packet 

* Terminology

In the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking, packet strictly refers to a
protocol data unit at layer 3, the network layer. A data unit at layer 2, the data
link layer, is a frame. In layer 4, the transport layer, the data units are segments
and datagrams. Thus, in the example of TCP/IP communication over Ethernet, a TCP
segment is carried in one or more IP packets, which are each carried in one or more
Ethernet frames. 


# Network topology

* Topic 
[Computer network]

* Definition
The physical or geographic locations of network nodes and links generally have
relatively little effect on a network, but the topology of interconnections of
a network can significantly affect its throughput and reliability. With many
technologies, such as bus or star networks, a single failure can cause the
network to fail entirely. In general, the more interconnections there are, the
more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install. Therefore
most network diagrams are arranged by their network topology which is the map
of logical interconnections of network hosts.


* Bus network
All nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium.
This was the layout used in the original Ethernet, called 10BASE5 and
10BASE2. This is still a common topology on the data link layer, although
modern physical layer variants use point-to-point links instead, forming a
star or a tree.

* Star network
All nodes are connected to a special central node. This is
the typical layout found in a small switched Ethernet LAN, where each
client connects to a central network switch, and logically in a wireless
LAN, where each wireless client associates with the central wireless access
point.

* Ring network
Each node is connected to its left and right neighbour node,
such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other
node by traversing nodes left- or rightwards. Token ring networks, and the
Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), made use of such a topology.

* Mesh network
Each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbours
in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any
other.

* Fully connected network
Each node is connected to every other node in the network.

* Tree network
Nodes are arranged hierarchically. This is the natural
topology for a larger Ethernet network with multiple switches and without
redundant meshing.
